Validation form made with JS and Html validation code  

## VALIDATION FORM MADE WITH HTML AND JAVASCRIPT  
This project is one of the projects available on Front End Mentors to practice some basic Javascript.

## ABOUT  
The aim of the project is:  
- to redesign the page so that it looks like as close as possible to the original version
- to use html code for basic validation of the form
- to implement the validation process by showing error messages in case some or all the fields are not properly filled in
- to show a final message, in case the user has filled in all the fields correctly  
 
The form is not connected to a server, so even though the fields are correctly filled in, the data is not being sent anywhere. It is just merely to practice Js validation code.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED  
Html, Css and Vanilla Javascript
